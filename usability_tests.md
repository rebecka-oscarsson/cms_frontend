# Usability testing

Goals: To find things that could be improved on the Spraakteknik website (desktop and mobile).

Method: The test person is sharing their screen and saying their thoughts out loud while using the website. The test person is given the task of trying to order a translation of a document for importing a cat from
English to Swedish.

## Test person 1 (Margit)

The tester is 70 years old and a moderate internet user. She is testing the website on her computer.

Margit opens the website and sees the start page. She tries to scroll down to find more information and is frustrated when it's not possible.

She then looks at the menu and sees the link called 'get a quote' but doesn't know what quote means. 'Is it 'offer' I should click to know what they can translate for me?' 
She clicks 'offer' and reads the text. 'Wow, that's a lot of text! There are so many languages one can get translations in!' She tries to click the list of examples of documents and is confused when the list items are not clickable. 

She then goes to the 'site language' and changes to Swedish. She goes to 'FÃ¥ en offert' and points out that there is no easy way to click and send an e-mail so she doesn't quite understand how to send her request. She also would like more info on how to send in her documents. By regular mail?

She thinks that offer/erbjudande sounds like there is something on sale and that the company logo has strange colors, is it supposed to have one gray letter or is that a mistake?

Margits comments after the test: Nice readable text with plenty of space. It's clear that the links in the menu are clickable because they change color. The start page looked like it would go on down and maybe there should be some info at the bottom.

## Test person 2 (Martin)

Note: I now changed the link offer/erbjudande to "our services"

Martin is 43 years old. He is a skilled internet user who does most of his errands online and has high demands on efficient websites. He is testing the site on his computer.
Martin goes to the start page. He looks at the links in the menu and wonders where to find out if the company offers translations of import documents ' 'our services' sounds right. After reading the start page he clicks 'our services' in order to find out more about the company and whether they offer what he needs. 'Aha there it says legal documents, that should include importing pets'.
He is confused as to why there is an 'about'-link and what is the difference from 'our services'. He clicks on the about-link, skims the text and determines he doesn't need to read that text right now.
Martin then goes to 'Get a Quote' and now knows how to send his request for the translation.
Martins comments after the test: I don't need that button on the first page saying 'get a quote', I wouldn't go straight to buy something before reading more about the company. Maybe it should link to 'Our services' instead.

## Test person 3 (Emmanuel)

Emmanuel is 39 years old and uses the internet frequently both on his phone and computer. He is testing the site on his phone (Nokia 1)
Emmanuel sees the start page and then clicks the three lines because he supposes that will open the menu. He clicks 'Our services' but that leads to a very long text that doesn't seem to tell him how to order a translation.
He clicks 'Contact' but there is no form for sending a request, he doesn't want to have to open his e-mail.
'Get a quote, I'm not sure what that is, unless it's a line from Shakespeare or someone'. He switches the language to Swedish. 'F' en offert, ok now I understand'.
Emmanuels comments after the test: I wanted a page for with clear information on how to send in my order. The different size headlines look weird ' they should be the same kind of font with serifs and not the same size'

# Conclusions

I got many ideas of changes I will make. 

The link that says 'offer' should be renamed 'our services'. 

The contact-link should be removed and contact details for the company moved to a footer

The "get a quote" -page needs to have a contact form so it's easier to send in a request. Possibly the link should be renamed ("how to order"?)

None of the users clicked the "call to action"-button on the first page. It probably needs to link somewhere else or be named something else since nobody wants to make a purchase without first reading about what the company offers.
